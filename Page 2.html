<div class="flex-box-2">

     <div style="order: 3"> NIWA is a science-based organisation that monitors how New Zealand’s weather, oceans, and environment are changing over time. They’ve done research showing how climate change is already making NZ hotter, wetter, and more unstable with sea levels rising, more floods and heatwaves, and changing rain patterns. Their site shares graphs, future predictions, and talks about how this affects not just the land, but animals and people too. Definitely worth checking if you want real, science-backed info.</div>

<div class="flex-box-3">

    <p>RNZ covers stories and interviews showing how climate change is already affecting real people and communities in New Zealand. From news on major floods to farmers struggling with drought, they give a human side to science. It’s less about charts and more about how daily life is changing. They also talk about what the government is (or isn’t) doing about it, and bring in voices from all over the country.</p>

<div class="flex-box-4">

    <div style="order: 4">Forest & Bird is all about protecting New Zealand’s native animals, plants, and wild places. They explain how climate change is messing with ecosystems, things like warmer seas affecting birds and fish, droughts hurting forests, and invasive species spreading faster. The site talks about what they’re doing to help (like tree planting and pest control) and how people can get involved. It’s more action-focused, and shows how nature and climate are connected in nz. </div>
