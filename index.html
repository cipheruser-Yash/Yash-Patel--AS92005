    <h2>
        The 1950's
    </h2>
<p>
    In the 1950s New Zealand’s nature felt like a different place. The land was still rich with dense native bush, birds filled the air with calls (even at night), and the seasons felt more predictable. People say winters were actually cold, with more frosts and snow in places that barely get it now. Summers were warm, but not boiling. The rivers ran clearer, glaciers looked massive and untouched, and coastal towns didn’t worry much about sea levels rising. Climate change wasn’t really a topic people talked about and to be fair, it didn’t feel like we needed to yet.

        The 80's-90's, Era were deforestation started
    </h2>

<p3>
    Fastforward to around the 1980s and 1990s, that’s when more changes started to be noticed. More cars, more cities growing, and more industries meant more emissions. Native forests kept shrinking from farming and development. Some birds and insects became harder to find. The weather started getting... weirder. Dry spells got longer in some areas, storms hit harder in others. But still, most people thought of it as just “bad weather,” not part of a bigger global thing.

        The modern Era 2010's & 2020's
    </h2>
 <p4>   By the time we hit the 2010s and 2020s, climate change wasn’t just a theory, it became visible. Sea levels around parts of NZ have already risen. There are places that flood more often now than they did just 10 years ago. Summers can bring dangerous heatwaves, while winters are warmer and sometimes wetter than expected. Places like the West Coast or Napier have faced major floods. Birds are shifting where they live because their food sources or homes are changing. Even farming which is a big deal in NZ . NZ is being affected by shifting rainfall and droughts. Suddenly, what felt far away is right here in our own backyard.
        Looking ahead to 2030 and beyond, it’s kind of up to us what happens next. Scientists say that if we keep releasing greenhouse gases at the current rate, we could see even more extreme weather, water shortages, and damage to ecosystems. But the future isn’t fully set in stone. There’s still time to shift things. That’s where the action of replanting native trees comes in to changing how we get energy, every little thing helps. Nature in New Zealand is strong and beautiful, but even it has limits.
